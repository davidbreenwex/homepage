<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a graduate of University College Dublin, where first studied for a 4 year Agricultural Science Degree. I worked for 7 years in my family business Breen Agricultural Services Ltd. I always had an ambition to work in IT and when I got the opportunity to go back to college to complete a Masters in Computer Science I jumped at the chance. I really enjoyed the course and graduated with first class honors. You can see some of the examples of my course work <a href="portfolio">here</a></p>
 
<p>I started work as an Application Support Engineer before the course was finished. The position was at Dedsert, an online sports betting company. I was promoted to BAU Team Lead after 8 months working in the company. This is my current position. You can learn more about my work experience <a href="/davidbreen2/experience.php">here</a> or check out my <a href="https://ie.linkedin.com/in/davidbreenwex/en">Linkedin page</a>.</p>
